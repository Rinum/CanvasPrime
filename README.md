Canvas'
===========

The Lightweight Canvas Framework
--------------------------------
' (Prime) follows the KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid - principle.

Prime provides a simple base for your animation, game, or project. It forces some code organization and automatically takes care of the renderloop. The best part is it can be used with most (if not all) canvas engines, modules, etc.

The concept behind the framework is that you have "Controllers" and "Objects."
Controllers handle all logic.
Objects contain information and rendering instructions.

Testimonial
-----------
I use the framework for all things canvas. It's fantastic! :)
